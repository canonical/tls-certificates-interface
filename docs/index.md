The TLS Certificate Interface is the library which contains the Requires and Provides classes for handling the TLS Certificates.

## Usage

This charm should not be deployed as it's a placeholder for the library. This library could be fetched and used to request and provide the certificates in the charms when it is needed. 

## Project and community
The TLS Certificate Interface Library is an open-source project that welcomes community contributions, suggestions, fixes and constructive feedback.
